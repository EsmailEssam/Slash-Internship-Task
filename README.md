# Slash-Internship-Task

## Building a Product Image Classifier

### Dataset Collection:
- The dataset was sourced from various categories available on the Slash app.
- It is categorized into four distinct classes:
  - 0: Nutrition
  - 1: Fashion
  - 2: Games
  - 3: Accessories

### Model Selection:
- Developing a model from scratch poses challenges due to the limited dataset size.
- Experimentation with several pre-trained models including Xception, VGG16, and MobileNet was conducted.
- The Xception model demonstrated superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy on both training and testing datasets.

### Model Evaluation:
- The model underwent testing using unseen data, yielding promising results.
